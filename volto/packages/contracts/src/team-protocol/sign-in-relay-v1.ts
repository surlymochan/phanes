// Frozen optional sign-in-relay-v1 wire contract.
//
// An owner or admin of a joined server signs the host in from their own computer. The host starts the
// sign-in and keeps the authorization page address; it opens no browser. The client opens that page
// in the user's own browser, and the page sends the user back to a loopback address. The client
// listens on that address on its own computer, and sends the query of the callback to the host with
// `complete`. The host finishes the sign-in. A member cannot use any route; `requireAdmin` on the host
// is the only gate.
//
// `mcp/start` and `provider/start` return a flow at once, and the sign-in runs on the host. `status` answers
// `authorizeUrl` once the host has the page address, `callback` when that page sends the user back to
// a loopback address on the host, and `result` once the sign-in ended. `callback` stays `null` when
// the address is not a loopback one: the client can then only send an address that the user pastes.
// `complete` takes only the query of the callback; the host builds the rest of the address from its
// own record. A flow completes once, only for the member who started it, and ends at `expiresAt`.
//
// `provider/start` signs in a provider's CLI on the host. Its page can return to the CLI's own loopback
// listener, which the host sends the query to, or it is a device page with no callback: the user only
// opens it, and the CLI finishes by itself.
//
// `link/start` relays a sign-in page that an agent of the host printed in its conversation, such as the
// page of an MCP server that the agent's CLI signs in to. The host accepts only an https page that
// returns to a loopback address with a `state`, and only when an agent message of `agentId` holds that
// exact address. The host sends the query to the loopback address of that page.
