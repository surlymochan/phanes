# lane-autodispatch (repo mirror)

Runtime copy lives on the box at `~/phanes-ctl/bin/autodispatch.py`.
Backend starvation rules: [`../autodispatch-backend-fallback.md`](../autodispatch-backend-fallback.md).

Two versions, one source: this file is the repo mirror, `~/phanes-ctl/bin/autodispatch.py` on the
box is the deployed runtime the control plane syncs from it (sync steps:
[`../autodispatch-backend-fallback.md`](../autodispatch-backend-fallback.md)); a change here is
only live on the box after that sync.

Base-commit validation: the base commit must exist in the target repo before a lane is assigned
(`git -C <repo> cat-file -e <base>^{commit}`). A missing base is fetched into the target repo and
the check is repeated (Refs #1810); a base that is still missing is reported and backed off as
before. A failing fetch aborts the dispatch right away: a later successful check (e.g. a concurrent
tick that fetched the object in the meantime) must never mask it.
