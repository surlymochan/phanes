// Shared by migration v37 and the separate new-database schema. IF NOT EXISTS throughout, because
// this text is both the migration and the tail of the latest schema.
//
// A routine result is the answer of an agent routine's run, sent on to a place outside OpenBot. The
// rows are written directly, not through `database.dispatch`: a delivery holds the answer text, and
// the event log is never deleted from.
//
// `routine_result_destinations`: the one place a routine sends its answers to. The names are the ones
// the user picked, kept so the editor can name a place whose connection does not run now. A connection
// row is never deleted, only turned off, so the reference never blocks a delete.
//
// `routine_result_deliveries`: one run's answer and what became of it, at most one per run. The row
// keeps its own copy of the place, so a later change of the routine's destination does not move an
// answer that is already on its way. `text` is null only for a quiet run, which sends nothing.
// `status`:
// - `pending` waits for `next_attempt_at`, or until `expires_at` ends it as `failed`.
// - `sending` is set before the post starts. A restart finds it `uncertain`: a long answer goes in more
//   than one post, so a part of it can be posted already.
// - `sent`, `failed` and `uncertain` end the row until the user sends it again.
// - `quiet` ends a run that had nothing to report.
